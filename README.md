The provided C# program is a standalone command-line application designed to facilitate the creation, management, and modification of recipes. The program adheres to a set of requirements, including allowing users to input details for a single recipe, display the full recipe in a neat format, scale the recipe by a specified factor, reset ingredient quantities to their original values, clear all data to enter a new recipe, and ensure that user data is not persisted between runs.

The code is organised into three classes: Ingredient, Step, and Recipe. The Ingredient class represents an ingredient with properties for name, quantity, and unit of measurement. The Step class represents a step in the recipe with a description property. The Recipe class encapsulates the recipe data, including lists of ingredients and steps. It provides methods to add ingredients and steps, display the full recipe, scale the recipe by a factor, reset quantities, and clear recipe data.

The Main method in the Program class serves as the entry point for the application. It prompts the user to enter the details for the recipe, including the number of ingredients and steps, and then iterates through each input to add ingredients and steps to the recipe. After displaying the full recipe, the program allows the user to scale the recipe, reset quantities, and clear recipe data based on user input.

Overall, the program provides a user-friendly interface for managing recipes, allowing users to easily input, view, and modify recipe details while ensuring that user data is stored in memory only during runtime and is not persisted between sessions. The code is well-structured, leveraging object-oriented principles to encapsulate data and functionality, and includes comments to explain variable names, methods, and logic for better readability and maintainability.
